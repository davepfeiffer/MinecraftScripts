# MinecraftScripts

Various scripts for automating things in Minecraft.

These scripts require AutoHotKey, which can be found [here](https://autohotkey.com/).

After autohotkey is installed, just rightclick on the .ahk file and choose 'run script' to enable the hotkeys.

The global 'constants' at the begining of the script must be changed if you are not using standard settings at 1080p.
This can be easily done by taking a screenshot and looking at the coordinates of the specified locations with MS paint.

Be sure to use the scripts responsibly and check with any server owners/admins before using them, as you may get banned!

Have fun crafting.
