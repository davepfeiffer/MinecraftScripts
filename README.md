# MinecraftScripts

Various scripts for automating things in Minecraft.

These scripts require AutoHotKey, which can be found [here](https://autohotkey.com/).

After autohotkey is installed, just rightclick on the .ahk file and choose 'run script' to enable the hotkeys.

The global 'constants' at the begining of the script must be changed if you are not using standard settings at 1080p.
This can be easily done by taking a screenshot and looking at the coordinates of the specified locations with MS paint.

The default hotkeys are:

- ALT + 1: Crafts the first row into a 3x3 recipe
- ALT + 2: Crafts the first 3 rows into 3x3 recipes
- ALT + 3: Crafts the first row (except the last slot) into a 2x2 recipe
- ALT + 4: Crafts teh frest 3 rows into 2x2 recipes

Be sure to use the scripts responsibly and check with any server owners/admins before using them, as you may get banned!

Have fun crafting.
